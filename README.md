Mortgage Calculator
===================

This is a simple GUI mortgage calculator written in Java using JavaFX. It allows users to input various parameters such as the desired loan amount, downpayment amount, loan term in years, repayment schedule (either Annuity or Linear), and annual interest rate.

## Features
The program provides the following features:

- Monthly payment calculation: The program calculates the monthly payment for the home loan, including the principal amount and the interest portion. The result is displayed as a table.
- Remaining balance tracking: The program displays the remaining balance on the loan after each monthly payment, allowing users to track their progress in repaying the loan.
- Filter by time interval (chart): Users can apply a filter to view only the payment amounts within a specific time interval, making it easier to analyze the loan repayment progress during a particular period.
- Report generation: Users can generate a report in a .xslx file format, which provides a summary of the loan repayment details.
- Graphical visualization: The program displays line charts that show the changes in payments over time for both Annuity and Linear repayment schedules, providing a visual representation of the loan repayment trends.
- Loan deferment option: Users can apply for a loan deferment, specifying the start date and duration of the deferment period. During the deferment period, the program calculates interest based on the specified deferment interest rate.

## Usage

- Input the desired loan amount, loan term in years and months, repayment schedule (Annuity or Linear), and annual interest rate.
